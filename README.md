Roman Numeral Converter


Roman Numeral converter made in vanilla JS/html5/css

Notes: 
1.) The convert to binary button has no functionality. I did not add it because there are no requirements for it in the test suite. Feel free to add things as you see fit.
2.) Basically, uses 1 for and 1 while loop to complete the checking and numeral building steps.
3.) that's it
